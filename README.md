This repository accompanies my Master's thesis, "Connecting to Home Through Sound: An Auditory World Map for Homesickness Relief". My name is Livia Theunissen, and this project was completed as part of my MSc in Information Studies at the University of Amsterdam.  The repository contains a short video walkthrough of the interactive prototype developed for the thesis. The prototype, Echome, explores how familiar and personally meaningful sounds can support reflection, memory, and emotional reconnection in moments of homesickness.  If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out.
